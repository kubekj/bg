# BG
A platform designed and developed from scratch, meant for athletes to customize their workouts and exercises, purchase training plans from a marketplace, and monitor their progress using diverse charts. Additionally, athletes can transition into trainers, enabling them to create and showcase their training plans on the marketplace. This feature also includes a dashboard for trainers to track their popularity and sales information.
